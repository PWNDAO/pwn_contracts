# PWN Protocol

PWN is a protocol that enables peer-to-peer (P2P) loans using arbitrary collateral. Our smart contracts support ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 standards, making it versatile and adaptable to a wide range of use cases.

## About

In the world of decentralized finance, PWN stands out with its unique approach to P2P loans. By allowing users to leverage different types of collateral, we provide flexibility and convenience that's unmatched in the industry.
