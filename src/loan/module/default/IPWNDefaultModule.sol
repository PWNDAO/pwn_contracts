 * The module must use the loan's state (fetched from the loan contract at the provided address)
 * to evaluate whether default conditions are met (e.g., time-based, debt limit, or other criteria).
 *
 * The module must also implement the `onLoanCreated` initialization hook, which is called by PWNLoan
 * at loan origination to configure the module for the specific loan. The hook must return a
